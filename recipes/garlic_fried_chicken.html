    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic Fried Chicken is a mouthwatering dish that combines the crispy satisfaction 
      of fried chicken with the irresistible flavor of garlic. Tender chicken breasts are seasoned 
      with a blend of aromatic herbs and spices, coated in a crispy breading, and deep-fried to perfection.

      and a burst of garlic goodness that will leave you craving more. Whether served as a comforting meal
